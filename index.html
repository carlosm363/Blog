  <h1>Building a Website to Raise Awareness About Climate Change</h1>
  <p class="date-author">Posted on: June 11, 2025<br>By: Carlos Moyano Rivera.</p>

  <p>Climate change is one of the most urgent issues facing our world today. From rising temperatures and melting ice caps to extreme weather events and threatened ecosystems, the effects are being felt across the globe. I wanted to do something about it—so I decided to build a website.</p>

  <h2>Why I Made This Website</h2>
  <p>It all started with a simple class project. A Capstone Project on just about evertything we wanted. I decided to do my topic on Climate Change. A lot of people hear the term “climate change” but don’t fully understand what’s causing it, how it affects them, or what they can do. My goal was to create a simple, clean, and informative website that helps people learn more and take meaningful steps.</p>

  <h2>What’s On the Site</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What is Climate Change?</strong> — A simple explanation of greenhouse gases, global warming, and the science behind it.</li>
    <li><strong>Current Impacts</strong> — Real-world examples of how climate change is affecting weather, sea levels, wildlife, and communities.</li>
    <li><strong>What You Can Do</strong> — Everyday actions people can take to reduce their carbon footprint and help the planet.</li>
    <li><strong>Resources</strong> — Links to scientific reports, environmental organizations, and educational videos.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How I Built It</h2>
  <p>I used basic HTML and CSS to start, keeping the layout simple and easy to navigate. I then expanded upon the layout, adding more pages, sources, resources, and advice. Things that lead you to active causes, organizations, petitions, and other projects helping towards climate change.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>Even a small website can make a difference if it reaches the right person. If you care about the environment and know how to code, I encourage you to use your skills to spread awareness. Together, we can educate others and inspire action.</p>
